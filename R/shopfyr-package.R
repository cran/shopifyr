#' R Interface to the Shopify API
#' 
#' This package aims to provide an easy-to-use R interface to the Shopify API. Before using this
#' package, it would be wise to become familiar with the official Shopify API documentation. You
#' can find it at \url{http://docs.shopify.com/api}. 
#' 
#' The workhorse of the package is the \code{\link{ShopifyShop}} class.
